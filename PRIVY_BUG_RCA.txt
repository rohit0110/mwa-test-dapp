Root Cause Analysis: Privy shouldAutoConnect Fails for Wallet Standard Wallets

The issue is a bug in Privy's shouldAutoConnect implementation that specifically affects Wallet Standard wallets (e.g., Mobile Wallet Adapter) but not injected wallets (e.g., Phantom, Solflare). When a page refreshes, Privy successfully restores the user authentication session (authenticated: true) but fails to reconnect to Wallet Standard wallets (walletsCount: 0), despite the wallet being successfully registered and available via getWallets().get(). This occurs because Privy's toSolanaWalletConnectors({ shouldAutoConnect: true }) has two different reconnection code paths: one for injected wallets that checks window.solana/window.phantom (which works), and another for Wallet Standard wallets that should query getWallets() and listen for registration events (which fails). Testing confirms that Phantom auto-reconnects successfully after refresh while MWA does not, proving Privy only checks for injected wallet objects during session restoration and does not re-query the Wallet Standard API. The wallet is present and functional (as evidenced by successful first-time connections and the wallet appearing in Wallet Standard checks), but Privy's shouldAutoConnect feature simply doesn't look for it when restoring the session.
